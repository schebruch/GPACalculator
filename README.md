# GPACalculator
A program that calculates user semester &amp; overall GPA

This program allows the user to input all grades and credit hours for each class they have taken.  It then asks for how many total semesters the user has taken in college.  Finally, it asks the user for the GPA of each prior semester (to calculate overall GPA).
